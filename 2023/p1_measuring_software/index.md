## How to contribute

To add a new article, follow the instructions below:

1. Fork the repo of the website on Github: <https://github.com/luiscruz/course_sustainableSE/>
2. Create a new markdown file inside the directory `2022/p1_measuring_software`
  - Use the following filename format: `g<group_number>_<1/2meaningful_keywords>.md`
  - Use the file `g8_template.md` has a template
  - If you want to add images, add it to `2022/img/p1_measuring_software/g<group_number>_<1/2meaningful_keywords>/`
3. Commit, Push.
4. Submit a pull request.

Before submitting the pull request, you should test whether your file is rendering properly in the website. This is jekyll-based website. Assuming you have it installed, you can simply run this command locally:

`bundle exec jekyll s --safe`

Your page should be listed here: <http://localhost:4000/course_sustainableSE/2022/p1_measuring_software/>

If you don't want to deal with jekyll, you can do it the slow and expensive way: 1) enable *github pages* in your fork repo 2) check your the deployed page. (I don't recommend it, though)

*Note: let me know if you run into any issue or if there's any step you think should be explained here.*
